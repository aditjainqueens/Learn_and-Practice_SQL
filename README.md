# Learn_and_Practice_SQL
I learned SQL under Udacity Introduction to Data Science nanodegree scholarship program partnered with Access Bank. 
The queries included are those I used while preparing for the final assessment.
The query files include the questions for the quizzes written as comments along side the queries i wrote as answers for the practice quizzes, the corrections for the answers and differences in the answers given, summaries of basic SQL concepts, the database used in the course and ERD for the data base.

I then practiced my knowledge of queries using Hackerrank. Attached are the queries i used along with their functions.

This can aid the understanding and use of SQL for beginners.
