# Learning_SQL_with_Udacity
I learned SQL under Udacity Introduction to Data Science nanodegree scholarship program. 
The queries included are those I used while preparing for the final assessment. 
The files also include queries as answers from the practice quizzes as well as summaries of how SQL works and is used.

This can aid the understanding and use of SQL for beginners.
