/*QUIZ_QUESTION
What is happening when you omit the ORDER BY clause when doing aggregates with window functions? Use the results from the queries above to guide your thoughts then jot these thoughts down in a few sentences in the text box below.*/

/*Without the order by,  there is no separation in the values per row. Rather than giving a unique value based on every new row or grouping, it gives a general aggregate.*/
